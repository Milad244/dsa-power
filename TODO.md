# TODOs

## TODO

- [ ] Separate node functions from BT (maybe)
- [ ] Format all files the same
- [ ] Add consts where needed
- [ ] Make open source and make contribution file and tell about some that can have more implementations: (queue, stack, DLL, str)

## Done

- [x] Implement BST
- [x] Add CUnit tests
- [x] Add size method in LL
